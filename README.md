# pool_cleaner
A 3D printable pool cleaner utilising the Venturi effect.

This design is based off one that a friend of mine bought. 
I have printed it on a Prusa i3 mk3 in PETG at 0.15 mm layer height and it worked really well.
I glued the parts together with super glue and it was more than strong enough.
The handle mounting thread is sized to fit the handle I had (some weird tapered thread with a 4 mm pitch and a circular profile) but you can model what you need and fit it in the 25 mm hex hole.
